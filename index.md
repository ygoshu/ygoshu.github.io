I am incoming **Machine Learning Engineer** on Goldman Sach's Core Machine Learning team. The team of seven is led by Professor Charles Elkan. I received my B.A. and M. Eng from Cornell University in computer science. My undergraduate research was advised by Professor Deborah Estrin in her [Small Data Lab](https://smalldata.io/) . My graduate research was advised by Professor Serge Belongie in his [SE3](https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/people/serge-belongie) computer vision lab. 

My current interests broadly lie in deploying machine learning applications at scale. Some applications of ML that are of interest to me are computer vision, recommendation systems, and finance. My most recent work explores work in few-shot image generation, adverserial training, few-shot text generation, and recommendation frameworks. 

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
