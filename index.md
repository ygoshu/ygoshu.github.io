I am an incoming **Machine Learning Engineer** at Goldman Sach's Core Machine Learning team. The team of seven is led by Professor Charles Elkan. I received my B.A. and M. Eng from Cornell University in computer science. My undergraduate research was advised by Professor Deborah Estrin in her [Small Data Lab](https://smalldata.io/) . My graduate research was advised by Professor Serge Belongie in his [SE3](https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/people/serge-belongie) computer vision lab. 

My current interests broadly lie in deploying machine learning applications at scale. Some applications of ML that are of interest to me are computer vision, recommendation systems, and finance. My most recent work explores work in few-shot image generation, adverserial training, few-shot text generation, and recommendation frameworks. Productizing my work has always been of interest to me. On the product end, I've explored and built products including the Grammarly for doctors, a VR based classorm, and natural language queries of large unorganized datasets.

## Extracurricular

I have devoted a lot of my non-engineering efforts to diversity initiatives throughout my professional career. I founded [Underrepresented Minorities in Computing](https://urmc-website.herokuapp.com/), which became a driving force of increasing minority entrance and retention in the computer science department at Cornell. Our supporters include many large tech firms and the CS department. I additionally was a section leader in [/dev/color](https://www.devcolor.org/), an organization that aims to empower Black software engineers to help one another grow into industry leaders. 

Additionally, I enjoy playing soccer (Barcelon!) and basketball (Chicago Bulls). I am also a huge F1 racing fan.
